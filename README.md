##Local installation
make sure you have django 1.4 running to prevent version errors.
if you are running mac/linux, run `touch dh_db.sql` to instantiate a new empty file (for sqlite3`
Make sure you have python's sqlite module installed. In Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install python-sqlite`. I think `easy_install` and `pip` will work too.

Use __branches__ to add new features so that the master is always deployable.

Viel Spass!!
